Welcome to Bcn Javascript Team! :raised_hands: Youâ€˜re about to become part of a world-class team of software engineering experts.
Innovation lies at the heart of our culture and we need your talent and expertise to stay ahead of the curve.
We would like this to be a zone of sharing and consulting where all the collaborators can solve their doubts about
how we are working as a team and some knowledge about the different projects that we are working on.

Also we would like to share knowledge through **code examples** and **best practises** so everyone can improve.

### Commits conventions :computer:

To take advantage of the autogenerator of changelogs, [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog), is need to follow the following conventional commits message format: https://github.com/pvdlg/conventional-changelog-metahub

```
commit -m "feat: the most awesome :shit: feature"
```

You can save time and memory using the next VSCode plugin: https://github.com/KnisterPeter/vscode-commitizen

### Branching strategy 

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cFkiFMDg3iFoI/giphy.gif" width="200" height="150" />

Branching strategy is the way will use GIT for managing the lifecycle of the source code.
Also the branching strategy is aligned with the CI platform tasks in order to manage release generation.

You can find the current branching strategy [here](https://google.com)

:warning: **Remember that all the teams has to follow this strategy**

<a name="proxy"></a>
### Proxy :gun:

Main proxy to be configured in your machine:

+ 192.168.62.5
+ 192.168.62.4


Most of the issues are related the proxy usage. ALL of those commands have a http-proxy option that you must use
in order to redirect all the traffic though our proxy.

For automated set up of the proxy see [resources/proxy-scripts](./resources/proxy-scripts)

#### Git proxy config

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://192.168.62.5:3128
HTTPS_PROXY=http://192.168.62.5:3128
git config --global http.proxy $HTTP_PROXY
git config --global https.proxy $HTTPS_PROXY
```

#### Brew install

```bash
ALL_PROXY=http://192.168.62.5:3128 brew install <name>
```

#### Gem install

```bash
sudo gem install --http-proxy http://192.168.62.5:3128 --https-proxy https://192.168.62.5:3128 <gema>
```
